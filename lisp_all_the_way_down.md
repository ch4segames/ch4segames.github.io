2019 is my year for game programming and for Lua. That's not an accident. I focused on scripting in the 90s, 
databases in early 2000, then mobile, then big data, then anayltics, and now cloud. Game development is my next area of focus
for my personal technolgoy development. I played with Lua during my mobile phase, so I was familiar with it. I was aware that Lua
is included as the primary scripting language for many game platform systems. 

For my personal projects, I tend to be all over the board. If I am using a lot of Python and R at work, then I veer toward those;
when I am revisiting SICP, then I might use Racket or Clojure. For the first time this year, I specifically told myself 
that I was going to use Lua for all my personal projects because game development is my long-term trend and Lua would keep my
head in the various game engines. 

That worked pretty well for the first half of the year. I spent some time with Corona, developing an Android app that I use
every day to automate the dial-in to my company's video conferencing system. I spent time with the wonderful game engine 
Defold. Then as summer approached, I started dusting off my Bootstrap World videos for my daughter; upgraded Dr. Racket, you know,
"just in case"; started looking longingly at my copy of SICP. 

From my months of lurking around the Lua community, I was aware of [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org) and [Urn](https://urn-lang.com)
and through them I became aware of various [Lisp Game Jams](https://github.com/lispgames/lispgames.github.io/wiki/Lisp-Game-Jams). _Maybe_, 
I could indulge in a little Lisp without abandoning my 2019 committment to Game Development and Lua.
