2019 is my year for game programming and for Lua. That combination is not an accident. Professionally, I focused on scripting in the 90s, databases in early 2000, then mobile, then big data, then anayltics, and now cloud. My "hobby" programming has 
always preceded any type of work-related technology. 

Game development is my next area of focus for my personal technology development. I played with Lua during my mobile phase, so I was familiar with it. I was aware that Lua is included as the primary scripting language for many game platform systems. So, 
Lua was a natural choice to pair with a general interest in game development. 

For my personal projects, I tend to be all over the board. If I am using a lot of Python and R at work, then I veer toward those; when I am revisiting SICP, then I might use Racket or Clojure. For the first time this year, I specifically told myself 
that I was going to use Lua for all my personal projects because game development is my long-term trend and Lua would keep my
head in the various game engines. 

That worked pretty well for the first half of the year. I spent some time with [Corona](https://coronalabs.com/), 
developing an Android app that I use every day to automate the dial-in to my company's video conferencing system. I spent time with the wonderful game engine [Defold](https://www.defold.com). Then as summer approached, I started dusting off my [Bootstrap World](https://www.bootstrapworld.org) videos for my daughter; upgraded [Dr. Racket](https://racket-lang.org), you know, "just in case"; started looking longingly at my copy of [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). 

From my months of lurking around the Lua community, I was aware of [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org) and [Urn](https://urn-lang.com) and through them I became aware of various [Lisp Game Jams](https://github.com/lispgames/lispgames.github.io/wiki/Lisp-Game-Jams). _Maybe_, I could indulge in a little Lisp without abandoning my 2019 committment to Game Development and Lua.
